 Question : Given n process with their burst times and arrival time .
	      Implement FCFS to find average waiting time and average turn arround time 
              also show waiting and turn around time for each 



  Complexity O(logn)


Example :

Enter the how many process
3
Enter process id, Arrival Time and Burst Time
1
0
40
Enter process id, Arrival Time and Burst Time
2
1
3
Enter process id, Arrival Time and Burst Time
3
1
1


process id	Arrival Time	Burst Time
1		0		40
2		1		3
3		1		1


Process Id	Arrival Time	Burst Time	 Completion Time	 Turn Arround Time	 Waiting Time
1		0		  40			 40			40			0
2		1		  3			 43			42			39
3		1		  1			 44			43			42


Avrage Wating Time = 27
Avrage turn around Time = 41
